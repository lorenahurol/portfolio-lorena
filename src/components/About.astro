      My name is Lorena â€“ My coding adventure goes way back to the 2010s, where
      I first dipped my toes into the world of HTML and CSS by tweaking Myspace
      and Tumblr themes. <br /> Back then, it was all about adding that perfect touch
      of aesthetic flair. <br />
      As I transitioned into adulthood, I carved out a career in media and design.
      It was a university project that brought me back to coding, reigniting a passion
      for web design and development.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 text-base text-body-color">
      I have over 7 years of digital agency experience where I built a career in
      the media industry, focusing in video editing and motion graphic design.
      During this time, I led projects that deepened my understanding of how
      design and technology intersect.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8 text-base text-body-color">
      Transitioning into UX/UI design, I spent over a year in a software
      development team, where I centered my approach on creating intuitive and
      accessible interfaces. Recently, I contributed to the development of an
      expense-sharing app at Explit, combining my design expertise with
      full-stack development to deliver a robust and user-friendly functional
      solution.
